    <<~EOS
      glassy is ad-hoc signed but not notarized by Apple (no paid Developer
      Program account behind this project yet). This cask clears the
      com.apple.quarantine flag on #{appdir}/Glassy.app during install so
      Gatekeeper doesn't block first launch with "Apple could not verify
      'glassy' is free of malware". If you'd rather see that warning and
      decide for yourself, download the .dmg from the Releases page instead:
