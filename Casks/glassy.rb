# Homebrew Cask template for glassy, a fast GPU-accelerated terminal emulator.
#   brew install --cask alliecatowo/tap/glassy
#
# TEMPLATE: the update-homebrew job in .github/workflows/release.yml renders it
# into Casks/glassy.rb of alliecatowo/homebrew-tap on every release. Edit this
# file, not the tap copy.
#
# This is the recommended macOS install path: it puts Glassy.app in
# /Applications AND symlinks the CLI binary embedded in the bundle
# (Contents/MacOS/glassy — the same binary that runs the GUI) onto PATH via
# the `binary` artifact below, so installing the cask alone gets you both
# the app and the `glassy` command with no separate Formula/glassy.rb
# install needed. Formula/glassy.rb still exists for Linux (Casks are
# macOS-only) and for anyone who explicitly wants a headless CLI-only build.

    <<~EOS
      glassy is ad-hoc signed but not notarized by Apple (no paid Developer
      Program account behind this project yet). This cask clears the
      com.apple.quarantine flag on #{appdir}/Glassy.app during install so
      Gatekeeper doesn't block first launch with "Apple could not verify
      'glassy' is free of malware". If you'd rather see that warning and
      decide for yourself, download the .dmg from the Releases page instead:
